## 🚩 The Problem Statement
In the current academic landscape, students face **cognitive overload**. They have access to unlimited resources but lack a structured strategy to utilize them.
* **Inefficient Time Allocation:** Students spend too much time on strong subjects and neglect weak ones.
* **Lack of Feedback Loops:** Traditional study plans are static; they do not evolve based on test performance.
* **Data Blindness:** Students cannot visualize their progress trajectories to predict future outcomes.

## 💡 The Solution

**EduPlanAI** is not just a scheduler; it is an **Academic Optimization Engine**. 

By ingesting student performance data and time constraints, EduPlanAI constructs a personalized, adaptive learning schedule. It treats education as a data science problem—minimizing "wasted hours" and maximizing "grade output."

### 🎯 Key Features
* **Smart Scheduling:** [Describe feature, e.g., Auto-generates study timetables.]
* **Performance Analysis:** Uses **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize student progress and identify weak areas.
* **Data Persistence:** Efficiently stores student records and logs using **SQLite**.
* **Data Processing:** Utilizes **NumPy** for fast numerical calculations and data handling.
